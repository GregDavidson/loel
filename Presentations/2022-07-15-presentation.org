* Presenting LOEL

** Setting the Space

The League of Extraordinary Learners (LOEL) is a design for a (mostly)
Internet-Hosted Learning Community which is Learner Centered and co-developed by
Learners and Experts.

Is it OK to record Audio?
Is it OK to distribute the Audio recording?

- LOEL is based on multiple demonstrated breakthroughs
      - LOEL's approach is very different from traditional education!
      - There are multiple successful models for Learner-Centered education!
      - I will begin by presenting the what and the why of LOEL's design
            - in an orderly, easy to understand fashion, i.e. top-down!
            - without us bogging down
- Your feedback now and later is essential
      - I want you to get
            - the current design of LOEL
            - And that everything is Open to Criticism
      - I am eager to delve deep with you on any issue
            - but maybe later!
      - Let's initially use Chat
            - for questions and comments
            - as much as possible
            - so we don't bog down
        
** Diving In

*** Top-Down Education vs. Bottom-Up Facilitated Learning

- Top-Down Teaching Paradigm
- Bottom-Up facilitation paradigm

*** Examples of Radical Alternatives

- Montessori
- Immersion: Language Acquisition, Mathland, Gamification
- the Keller Plan

*** Why LOEL distances itself from Educational Institutions
- Anecdote of my attempt to improve my French
- Montessori getting sidelined into schools for elite young children
- Keller Plan at UC San Diego and UC Irvine

*** The LOEL Design

*** Original Innovative Software Tools and Wicci approach

Curricula consist of Modules
- Modules form Roadmaps
- There's more than one way to learn things!
 
Modules consist of Frames
- Frames fulfill the intent of the module
 
Frames consist of
- Documents --> Notebooks --> Immersive Worlds
- Projects
- Self-Assessment Tools

Frames have FAQ nodes associated with each element
- FAQ nodes use the Stack Overflow model

*** The Interim GitHub Approach
