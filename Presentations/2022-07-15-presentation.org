** Setting the Space

The League of Extraordinary Learners (LOEL) is a design for a (mostly)
Internet-Hosted Learning Community which is Learner Centered and co-developed by
Learners and Experts.

- Is it OK to record Audio?
- Is it OK to distribute the Audio recording?

LOEL is based on multiple demonstrated breakthroughs
- LOEL's approach is very different from traditional education!
- There are multiple successful models for Learner-Centered education!
- There's a lot to go through today!
- I will begin by presenting the what and the why of LOEL's design
      - in an orderly, easy to understand fashion
      - without us bogging down
      - i.e. top-down!
            - oh, the irony!

Your feedback now and later is essential
- Let's maximize the use of the /Chat Tool/
- for this first, information rich part
      - type your questions and comments into the chat
      - I'll try to respond to what you're writing there
            - interrupt me if I seem to miss something important!
      - I'll review the chat later to improve the presentation
            - so put everything there you can think of!

- I want you to understand
      - the current design of LOEL
      - and that everything is /Open to Criticism!/
- I am eager to delve deep with you on any issue
      - but maybe later!

** Diving In

*** A Breakthrough in Education is Needed!

#+begin_quote
Civilization is a race between education and disaster. H.G. Wells

The US vs the World
- The US spends massively on education
- Education in the US is not working well
- Many other countries do better
- Many other countries do much worse
- [[https://rossieronline.usc.edu/blog/u-s-education-versus-the-world-infographic/][US Education vs. World Infographics]]
- [[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/07/us-education-spending-finland-south-korea][US Education vs. Finland and South Korea]]

Most Students in the US are
- Semi-literate at best
- Trained into /Learned Helplessness/
      - Especially in Math and other "solids"
- Civics, Geometry, etc. Descoped

While education in some countries seems to be working better than in the US, how
would we know if it is falling short of meeting the potential of young people?

This is widely held to be a crisis
- Human productivity is key to individual and societal wealth.
- Education is the foundation of freedom and productivity.
- Very bad for creating a post-scarcity future!

Political and institutional attempts to improve things
- Are not helping much, if at all.
- It may be a paradigm problem.
- A paradigm which occurs worldwide

*** Top-Down Education vs. Bottom-Up Facilitated Learning

Top-Down Teaching Paradigm
 
- The US system was based on the (German) Prussian system
- Conforming to military command
- Teachers under tight administration control
- Homogenous cohorts of
      - Students sitting in formation
      - Hold still while we do education to you!
- Stop/Start when bells ring
- Judging, evaluating and permanently labeling students based on
      - Conformance, Compliance, Assignments, Tests
 
Bottom-Up Facilitation Paradigm

- What might that look like?

*** Examples of Radical Alternatives

**** Montessori

#+begin_quote
Humans have more capacity to learn than teachers have capacity to teach.
- Maria Montessori
#+end_quote

Montessori "teachers" are trained
- first to observe
- second to facilitate

Students explore projects
- projects are designed to provide feedback
- students select which projects to explore projects
- other students have more impact than the "teacher" does

**** Immersion and Constructive Learning

Language Acquisition

**** Mastery Education and the Keller Plan

Traditional education is not just top-down but it also uses tests and
assignments to judge students' level of competence with course material.
An alternative is Mastery Education where tests and assignments are used
to assist students in mastering course material rather than judging them.

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keller_Plan][Keller Plan]], developed in the 1960s, was a popular form of Mastery Education
in the 1970s.

UC San Diego and UC Irvine used a Mastery Education system inspired by the Keller
Plan for a number of key lower division courses in the late '70s and early '80s.

UC San Diego
      - General Psychology
      - Introduction to Computer Science
            - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Bowles][Professor Ken Bowles]]
      - Honors Physics
        
UC Irvine, Mathematics
      - [[https://www.educause.edu/ir/library/html/erm/erm99/erm9946.html][Interview with Professor Alfred Bork]]
      - [[https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Alfred-Bork-69661195][Alfred Bork papers]]
        
UCSD CS first Keller-inspired course outperformed traditional course
- run against conventional course for a year
- students evaluated using A-F grades in both systems
- Conventional course awarded grades based on
      - test scores and evaluation of homework
- "Keller" course awarded grades based on
      - amount of material mastered
- more than 80% of "Keller" students got A-grades
      - very few B-grades or C-grades
      - about the same got D-grades and F-grades as conventional course
      - basically, any students who engaged with the course got an A-grade
- Comprehensive evaluations at the end of the courses
      - Among A-grade students
      - "Keller" students significantly outperformed conventional course
        students!
- the traditional system was discontinued

Details of UCSD Computer Science System
- Open Laboratory
- Group Projects
- Peer Facilitators
      - Mentor students
      - Contribute tests and other material
      - Grade (pass/no-pass) projects and tests
      - Motivation
            - learn a lot
            - make a difference
            - get academic credit
- Material was divided into modules
      - Challenging Projects expected to be done with a group
      - Individual assessment on completed project
            - Individual must understand all aspects of solution
            - Regardless of who in their group did which parts
      - full-coverage tests to pass each module
            - 100% score required or retake next day
            - Students loved them!
      - If student completed all modules, they got an A-grade.
      - Otherwise student grade based on a combination of
            - number of modules completed
            - grade from conventional final exam
- Project members
      - selected from peer facilitators
      - get work-study funds
      - create software infrastructure
      - that software changed the world!

*** Why LOEL distances itself from Educational Institutions

[Anecdote] Before my Freshman year at UCSD I met with a counselor to plan my
courses. I asked what courses I could take to improve my French. The counselor
looked at my transcript and said "you don't need to take any more French, you've
already completed your language requirement". I said "yes, I know, but I'm just
barely proficient and I'd like to improve my French." The counselor looked at me
like I was especially stupid and repeated, more slowly this time: "you don't
need to take any more French, you've already completed your language
requirement".
 
Maria Montessori designed and targeted her schools for poor children in the
slums of Rome and Calcutta. Now (at least in the US) Montessori Schools are
expensive schools almost exclusively available for the children of the elite.
 
The Keller Plan courses at UC San Diego, UC Irvine were shut down by the
administrator, who claimed that they were an example of "Grade Inflation,"
despite proof that they were the opposite. I later found out that this had
happened in most places the Keller Plan had been tried. Interestingly, the
administration was perfectly happy to allow the Physics Department to continue
to use the Keller Plan for their special Honors Physics courses.

Bottom Line: Conventional schools are optimized for selling certificates and
producing a Bell Curve, they are not optimized for education!

*** The LOEL Design

**** Participants

- Learners
- Peer Facilitators
- Experts

**** Materials

- Curricula which leverage existing Open Culture materials
- Free Accounts for Learners, etc.
- Learning Planning Tool
      - Find Curricula, Modules
      - Find Partners, Peer Facilitators

**** Original Innovative Software Tools and Wicci approach

Curricula consist of Modules
- Modules form Roadmaps
- There's more than one way to learn things!
 
Modules consist of Frames
- Frames fulfill the intent of the module
- Frames have associated feedback "tests" or "projects"
 
Frames consist of
- Documents --> Notebooks --> Immersive Worlds
- Projects
- Self-Assessment Tools

Frames have FAQ nodes associated with each element
- FAQ nodes use the Stack Overflow model

*** The Interim GitHub Approach

All materials Open Culture in =git= repositories.

Everyone can clone the repositories.
Everyone can improve the materials and submit =pull= requests.
- peer facilitator contributions prioritized
- students and expert contributions supplementary

*** The Eventual /Wicci System/ Approach

The [[https://gregdavidson.github.io/wicci-core-S0_lib/][Wicci System]]
- Like a Wiki system, e.g. Wikipedia, only more general purpose
- special advantages for collaborative development of diverse materials
- ideal for the LOEL
- needs further development to get out of the research phase!

*** What We Need Now

We need collaborators!

We need /leaders/ who will enroll
- Learners
- Volunteers
      - Peer Facilitators
      - Initial Content Creators
      - Observers
- More Leaders!
 
We need Technical Volunteers
- To help create and maintain our infrastructure
- To complete the Wicci project
 
We need people to create our Organization
- Creating a Not-For-Profit Foundation
- Some Fundraising Needed!
 
We need Curriculum Creators
- Any Curricula Our Creators and Leaders Can Support
 
We will initially Prioritize our Computing Curriculum
- Computing Curricula needs good projects
      - Use LOEL infrastructure wherever feasible
- We have material for this already
