<h2 id="loeldevelopmentplan">LOEL Development Plan</h2>

<p>This Plan or Roadmap is organized by the construction and
maintenance of Tools to be used by Learners and Peers to
support Learners&#8217; Educational Objectives. Development and
improvement of LOEL Tools are ongoing once started.</p>

<p>Essential <a href="loel-tools.html">LOEL Software Tools</a> will
initially be designed and developed by LOEL staff. The
continued design and development of LOEL Software Tools will
be transferred to Students and Peers managed by Staff as soon
as possible. Eventually most management will also be transferred
to Senior Facilitators and staff will step back into a primarily
supportive role.</p>

<p>Please refer to the <a href="loel-tools.html">LOEL Tools</a> in
conjunction with this document.</p>

<h2 id="planningforexponentialgrowth">Planning for Exponential Growth</h2>

<p>This Roadmap is designed to encourage and manage exponential
growth. The problems with exponential growth are</p>

<ul>
<li>in it&#8217;s early phases things grow slower than expected</li>
<li>in it&#8217;s later phases things grow faster than expected</li>
<li>it&#8217;s unpredictable when the transition from slow to fast will occur</li>
</ul>

<p>The important things about managing an exponential
process is to make sure that</p>

<ul>
<li>the possibility of early large growth is planned for</li>
<li>processes tending to damp the exponential growth are identified and eliminated</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of the first problem with exponential growth, this
plan may initially be over-optimistic. We must be prepared
for a range of growth rates. Getting the strategy right will
maximize the growth rate and minimize disruption.</p>

<p>The markers Q1 - Q6 are intended as stages of a few months
each, perhaps as short as a quarter, perhaps somewhat longer.</p>
