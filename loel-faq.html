<h2 id="whoareourresourcesfor">Who Are Our Resources For?</h2>

<h3 id="wedirectlytargetlearners">We Directly Target Learners</h3>

<p>LOEL directly targets its programs to Learners i.e. people
with strong interests in learning challenging material
extending beyond what might be supported by any educational
institution in which they might be enrolled. We especially
wish to support those interested in and engaged in learning
the often challenging STEM subjects - Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics. However, we are not limiting
our support to STEM subjects.</p>

<p>We assume that LOEL Learners are already browsing the
Internet looking for resources to satisfy their interests
and curiosity. Our job is to assist them in locating and
successfully employing such resources, including assisting
them in finding peers and mentors and helping them manage
their learning process. It is also our job to make it
possible for Learners to contribute to one another&#8217;s
success.</p>

<h3 id="whysaylearnersratherthanstudents">Why Say &#8220;Learners&#8221; Rather Than &#8220;Students&#8221;</h3>

<p>The term &#8220;Student&#8221; emphasizes a person as occupying a role
within an Education Institution. Typically a Student is
pursuing a Course Of Study defined by the Institution rather
than the Student&#8217;s own interests. Young Extraordinary Learners
tend to be learners whose curiosity and interest in
learning goes beyond the scope of institutional programs.
We emphasize this vital difference when we call such
Students &#8220;Learners&#8221;.</p>

<h3 id="howcanadultssupportyoungerlearners">How can Adults support Younger Learners?</h3>

<p>Adults are, of course, welcome to use our materials in their
own Learning.</p>

<p>In addition we welcome Adult Partners who can participate as</p>

<ul>
<li>Mentors in areas where they have expertise</li>
<li>Contributors to our materials</li>
<li>Volunteer Staff</li>
<li>Fundraisers</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="whatabouteducationalinstitutionsandnetworks">What about Educational Institutions and Networks?</h3>

<p>LOEL designs its materials to be useful to Learners
whether they are enrolled as Students in</p>

<ul>
<li>Conventional Schools

<ul>
<li>Primary and Secondary Schools</li>
<li>Colleges, Universities, Professional Schools, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Alternative Schools

<ul>
<li>Magnet, Montessori, Waldorf, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Alternative Educational Programs

<ul>
<li>e.g. Homeschooling Networks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>or none of the above!</li>
</ul>

<p>We welcome the use of our resources by the faculty or
administrators of any educational programs for the benefit
of their Students and we consider it to be their job to
adapt our materials as needed to fit into their curriculum
and classrooms and to satisfy any of their institutional
requirements in regard to using our materials.</p>

<p>We welcome the support of administrators, teachers,
professors, etc. as Adult Partners.</p>

<h3 id="whataboutcollegesuniversitiesandprofessionalschools">What about Colleges, Universities and Professional Schools?</h3>

<p>Colleges, Universities and Professional Schools offer
valuable educational programs and credentials. While these
programs are increasingly available in the form of on-line
materials and on-line courses and prestigious credentials
can increasingly be earned through on-line study as well,
there remain decided advantages for Learners to participate
in programs of these kinds of Institutions, especially
strong 4-year programs and most especially Graduate School.</p>

<p>We encourage and support our Learners to enroll in any
College, University or Professional School programs which
will advance their educational and/or career goals.</p>

<p>Our primary relationship with Colleges and Universities is
to ensure that our Learners</p>

<ul>
<li>have a solid college-preparatory education

<ul>
<li>including passing on-line versions of many courses</li>
</ul></li>
<li>will be able to present very strong applications, including

<ul>
<li>high scores on entrance exams</li>
<li>records of impressive accomplishments</li>
<li>strong recommendations from recognized experts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>will be first in line for programs such as

<ul>
<li>scholarships, fellowships, work-study programs, etc.</li>
<li>which do NOT incur student debt</li>
</ul></li>
<li>are supported, while in college by our

<ul>
<li>network of fellow Learners, Peers, Mentors, etc.</li>
<li>resources related to their courses of study</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>We welcome the support of Institutional Faculty,
Assistants and Administrators as Adult Partners.</p>

<h3 id="whatabouttheparentsofextraordinarylearners">What About the Parents of Young Extraordinary Learners?</h3>

<p>We welcome the participation of Learners&#8217; Families and Adult
Family Friends in our programs as we welcome all Adult
Partners. Adult Family and Family Friends can have a strong
positive impact on the success of Young Extraordinary Learners.</p>

<p>In some cases Family and Friends can present obstacles to a
Young Extraordinary Learner&#8217;s success. We suggest <a
href="loel-media.html#materialsprimarilyforpartners" target="_blank">
materials in our Educational Resource Map</a> which directly
address some of these issues.</p>

<h2 id="summercampsandotherintensiveprograms">Summer Camps and other Intensive Programs</h2>

<h3 id="whatisourrelationshipwithlocalintensiveprograms">What is our relationship with Local Intensive Programs?</h3>

<p>Gathering a medium to large collection of Learners in the
same place for an intensive program can be extremely
valuable for Learners. Although such programs are not our
primary focus we strongly approve of them and are supportive
of them in our own way.</p>

<p>We exist to contribute to all STEM Learners which definitely
includes the STEM Learners who are participating in any
Local Intensive Programs. The people running such programs
might easily become official Partners in our organization,
especially if they follow the Learning Partnership Model.</p>

<p>We are happy to list local programs in our Resource
Directory and help make sure that our Learners, Peers and
Other Partners in that local area are aware of them.</p>

<p>Our on-line resources are available for use in Local
Programs, just as they are available for Institutions.</p>

<p>To the extent that a group of Local Programs follow a
Partnership Model similar to ours with &#8220;Learners&#8221;, &#8220;Peers&#8221;
and &#8220;Others&#8221; offering facilitation, improving course
materials, allowing Learners to become Peers, etc. we embrace
their partnership.</p>

<h3 id="whydontwecreateandsponsorlocalprograms">Why Don&#8217;t We Create and Sponsor Local Programs?</h3>

<p>Nearly all successful educational programs in the Past have
been tied to a specific institution or local project.</p>

<p>Today the single biggest opportunity for impacting the
maximum numbers of Learners is operating effectively via the
Internet.</p>

<p>We believe that Local Programs are best created and
maintained by committed people in that locality.
Participants in those programs get the benefit of local
support and addition they can participate fully in any and
all Internet-Based programs such as those offered by the
LOEL.</p>

<p>Local Short-Term Intensive Programs such as Summer Camps,
Science Fairs, etc. have special need of the support of LOEL
Programs since when their Intensive is over the Learners may
be left without the continuing support needed to utilize the
gains from their participation in their intensive program.</p>
