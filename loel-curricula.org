* Existing and Possible LOEL Courses

We have some existing LOEL courses and materials to create more.

In addition, there are quite a number of courses where sufficient
non-proprietary material exists online that we don't need to initially create
our own materials, only a directory of resources is needed and a convenient way
for our Students, Peer Facilitators and Experts to collaborate.

** Existing LOEL Courses

Courses which are at least at an Alpha level, i.e. they can
be used /now/, even as they are further developed.

Do you have any courses to contribute for this section?

- Computing Magic

- Create Your Course

- Programming in C

** Pre-Alpha LOEL Courses

These are courses which we already have significant existing materials for and
which could be turned into a course in a couple of months.
