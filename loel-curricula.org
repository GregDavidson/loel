* Current and Future LOEL Courses

We have some existing LOEL courses and materials to create more.

In addition, there are quite a number of courses where sufficient
non-proprietary material exists online that we don't need to initially create
our own materials, only a directory of resources is needed and a convenient way
for our Students, Peer Facilitators and Experts to collaborate.

** Current LOEL Courses

Courses which are at least at an Alpha level, i.e. they have run successfully
and they are open to new Learners and Collaborators.

- Experts :: Do you have any courses to contribute for this section?

- [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/computing-magic][Computing Magic]]

- [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/C-By-Example][Programming in C By Example]]

- Create Your Course :: A notebook-oriented guide for creating your own courses
  on any subject.  Under development, ask if you're interested!

** Free Content Project Courses

These are courses where you work with a Mentor on an existing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content][Free Content]]
project, e.g. a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software][Free Software]] Project. Your mentor assists you in learning
mastery skills as you develop improvements to the project, typically in
collaboration with other Learners and Experts.

- Experts :: Are you willing to serve as a Mentor for /Free Content/ Projects,
  your own or other?
