* The LOEL Strategic Roadmap

Our Strategic Plan and How You Can Participate!

** From our Original Plan to our New Plan

When LOEL began we had a promise of funding from a private foundation and we
created an [[https://gregdavidson.github.io/loel/loel-plan.html][Ambitious Plan]] making use of [[https://gregdavidson.github.io/loel/loel-tools.html][Innovative Software]] we would develop. A
couple of months later that foundation decided to support a less radical project
instead (school science fairs). LOEL got put on the back burner for a few years.

The original plan is still part of our vision and future and it is too ambitious
for our current resources. We are looking for ways to move forward now on a more
modest foundation. As our resources grow, we will to revisit and strategically
adopt elements of the original plan.

Everything in this plan is only possible with your participation. And we are
open to changing and expanding this plan to best support your participation and
the strategic growth of this initiative!
