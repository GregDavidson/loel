* LOEL Meeting - Welcome, AMA, Tech Tour

*** The Meeting Announcement

The number and diversity of people interested in LOEL continues to grow.
Eventually we'll get to a point where we'll want to have breakout rooms for
special project groups, but we're not there yet.  Let's try the following
hybrid approach:
- Let's meet for 1 hour
      - when :: Saturday 24 September 10:30am Pacific Time
      - Link :: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/810472918
      - password :: abundance
- We'll begin by welcoming anyone new
- I'll explain our new roadmap (see below)
- There will be a 30-minute AMA (ask me anything about LOEL)
- It would be helpful if you've already looked at
      - Our [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/loel/blob/main/Meetings/2022-07-15-loel-intro-meeting.org][introductory presentation]] (the url changed!)
      - Our [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/loel/blob/main/loel-roadmap.org][new roadmap]]
      - Our [[https://gregdavidson.github.io/loel][original website]]
- We'll conclude the meeting by surveying
      - who's interested in participating at this time
      - and in what ways
- I'll stay online for up to 30 minutes after the meeting if there is interest
  in specialized topics.
