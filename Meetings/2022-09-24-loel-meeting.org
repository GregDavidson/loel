* LOEL Meeting - Welcome, AMA, Tech Tour

*** The Meeting Announcement

The number and diversity of people interested in LOEL continues to grow.  
Eventually we'll get to a point where we'll want to have breakout rooms for
special project groups, but we're not there yet.  Let's try the following
hybrid approach:
- Let's meet for 1 hour
      - when :: Saturday 24 September 10:30am Pacific Time
      - Link :: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/810472918
      - password :: abundance
- We'll begin by welcoming anyone new
- I'll explain our new roadmap (see below)
- There will be a 30-minute AMA (ask me anything about LOEL)
- It would be helpful if you've already looked at
      - Our introductory presentation (the url changed!)
https://github.com/GregDavidson/loel/blob/main/Meetings/2022-07-15-loel-intro-meeting.org
      - Our new roadmap:
https://github.com/GregDavidson/loel/blob/main/loel-roadmap.org
      - Our original website:
https://gregdavidson.github.io/loel/
- We'll conclude by surveying
      - who's interested in participating
      - in what ways
- I'll stay online for up to 30 minutes after the meeting if there is interest
  in specialized topics.
