* Meeting on the LOEL Wicci Platform, Saturday, 8 October 2022

** Let's Be In Communication and Collaboration!

Our primary discussion Forum is the #the-wicci channel on the LOEL Discord.
Here's an invite if you're not yet on it:
- https://discord.gg/hYBjNczq
- Note: This invite will expire in 7 days, i.e. by 17 October 2022

It may also be useful to be on the WhatsApp Wicci Announcements list
- Invitation link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/J7JJVmqpuCkHHnLzze8tzN
- Note: Please don't use the WhatsApp list for discussion, it's intended to be
  very low bandwidth so that you could have its messages pop up on your phone
  without it being much of a bother!

Let me know if and when you think it would be valuable to have a separate
announcement list for the Wicci as opposed to the more general League of
Extraordinary Users List!

Saving the best for the last, the current working repositories for all things
Wicci are on GitHub, conveniently linked from [[https://gregdavidson.github.io/wicci-core-S0_lib][this web page]]. Without needing to
know anything about Git or GitHub, you can post Issues on any of these GitHub
repositories. Once you are up to speed with Git, you can (and I hope you will)
fork the Wicci repositories you want to study and improve, and send me pull
requests! Be sure you understand the copyright assignment consequences first,
though!

** Learning Some Tools To Participate

Depending on the manner in which y'all would like to participate, there are some
software tools, languages and techniques which will be applicable. Y'all are
sufficient quick imnsho that you can pick up any of these you don't know pretty
quickly, especially with the amazing support available in our group. Please
ignore any false modesty and impostor syndrome your ego may generate, it doesn't
fool me! And hey, it would be cool to expand or create LOEL Courses for any of
these topics. A great way to master something is to write down what you're
learning as if you're teaching someone else!

** Engaging With Wicci Development

For the Front End
- a subset of the usual web tech
- simpler than usual, because all the heavy lifting is being done server-side
- this can wait a few months until the back end has gotten back to Alpha Status

For the Back End
- Learn Racket for the Shim and for Enlightenment
      - Please start with [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/computing-magic/blob/main/Modules/Module-1/module-1.org][Computing Magic Module 1]]
- Learn SQL and PostgreSQL
      - Please start with [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/computing-magic/blob/main/Modules/Module-5/module-5.org][Computing Magic Module 5]]
- Learn Git, GitHub, Emacs and OrgMode and Scripting
       - Please start with [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/computing-magic/blob/main/Modules/Module-2/module-2.org][Computing Matic Module 2]]

Look at that, LOEL already has some material for all of the most important prerequisites!
- and we'll use the LOEL process to improve these as we use them!
- those of you who already have all of these prerequisites can
      - pretend to be /Peer Facilitators/ by putting yourself in that mindset
      - play /expert/ when that's absolutely required!
      - Please understand the difference between these two modes!!

Getting going with the Backend
1. Install PostgreSQL on your system
2. Clone the initial GitHub repositories
       - the Wicci Core (Schema 0)
       - the Wicci Tools and Docs
       - the Racket version of the Wicci Shim
3. Get it all to work from Emacs
       - Being able to build, run, explore and edit the Wicci

There's an optional prerequisite if you want to work on the low-level part of
Wicci Schema 1. Part of Schema 1 adds some PostgreSQL extensions written in C so
that they'll run as fast as regular PostgreSQL features. If you don't know C, I
have a Computing Magic short course for that too! It's also fine to leave that
bit for others and move on.

I'm not aware of any other prerequisites needed for the rest of the Wicci
System, it will just take time to get familiar with it. Time which I hope will
be very enjoyable, if you have a certain kind of brain! While the Wicci is
ambitious, it is designed to be accessible: Each Schema after Schema 0 adds only
one coherent piece of functionality and only depends on the earlier ones.

** What We Covered In The Meeting

*** A Bit of Background Reading

I very briefly summarized two papers I wrote in preparation for this Meeting.
They're short and I recommend reading them carefully and I hope that you'll
discuss them (post comments, questions, etc.) with us on the Discord.

- [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/wicci-doc/blob/master/Fundamental-Concepts/document-possibilities.org][Document Possibilities]]
- [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/wicci-doc/blob/master/Fundamental-Concepts/database-possibilities.org][Database Possibilities]]

*** Explore and Light Up The Discord!

I hope that you'll all peruse the rest of the LOEL Discord, GitHub Repository
and the Computing Magic Repostory at your leisure and share what you discover
there on the Discord too.

Bringing the Discord alive with our discoveries and creative engagement will
benefit the Wicci and LOEL project enormously. It will bring these projects
alive, stimulate our participation and draw in others!

*** The Wicci Walkthrough

I established some context using some Wicci Diagrams
- The [[http://gregdavidson.github.io/wicci-doc/Diagrams/wicci.png][Wicci Wiki Use Case Overview Diagram]]
      - This is the first application I imagined for the Wicci
      - And the Wicci can serve many other needs as well, it's actually a /Platform/
- The [[http://gregdavidson.github.io/wicci-doc/Diagrams/W_Standard_Web_Architecture_v2.svg][Standard Enterprise Web Architecture]]
      - This is how most big web services work, and it should be embarrassing!
- The [[http://gregdavidson.github.io/wicci-doc/Diagrams/W_Wicci_and_Standard_Web_Architecture_v2.svg][Wicci Web Architecture]]
- These documents and part of the [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/wicci-doc][Wicci Documentation Update Project]]
