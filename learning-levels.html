<h1 id="levelsoflearning">Levels of Learning</h1>
<div class="cols" >

<h2 id="learningtakesplaceatmanylevels">Learning Takes Place at Many Levels</h2>

<p>There are a number of ways of characterizing different kinds
of learning. For simplicity we&#8217;ll introduce four different
&#8220;Levels&#8221;:</p>

<ul>
<li>Level 0: Learning Without Existing Explanations</li>
<li>Level 1: Learning From Primary Explanations</li>
<li>Level 2: Educational Materials &amp; Facilitated Learning</li>
<li>Level 3: Procedural Training for Specific Tasks</li>
</ul>

<p>We also want to introduce two different &#8220;Modes&#8221;:</p>

<ul>
<li>Top-Down: Something other than the Learner&#8217;s interest is directing the process</li>
<li>Interest-Directed: The learner&#8217;s interest is directing the process</li>
</ul>

<p>We claim that the most powerful Learning is in the
&#8220;Interest-Directed&#8221; modes of Levels 0, 1 and 2. In the
United States and many other countries, primary, secondary
and undergraduate college education systems mostly use the
Top-Down modes of Level 2. Trade Schools and other
vocational programs mostly use the Top-Down modes of Level 3.</p>

<p>Each of these Levels can be used successfully in some
circumstances. Our claims are that (1) some of these Levels
are over-used, (2) the Top-Down mode is over-used and (3)
there are alternatives to the traditional and most common
approaches that can be much more effective!</p>

<h3 id="level0:learningwithoutexistingexplanations">Level 0: Learning Without Existing Explanations</h3>

<p>Human curiosity often brings us face-to-face with questions,
known to researchers as <em>problems</em>, where there are not yet
any organized and accepted answers or explanations.</p>

<p>The processes of Science, Mathematics and Creative
Engineering all require Level 0 Learning. The Learner is in
a direct relationship with Physics, Logic and Pragmatic
Possibility.</p>

<p>Level 0 Learning generally benefits from, but can also be hindered by</p>

<ul>
<li>Interaction with Colleagues</li>
<li>Speculative and Fragmentary Explanations</li>
<li>Analogies with Similar Problems with More Mature Explanations</li>
<li>Facility with the Discovery Processes of their Discipline</li>
</ul>

<p>Nearly everything we learned as children is also Level 0
learning, including our fluency in our native language(s).
More will be said about this below!</p>

<h3 id="level1:learningfromprimaryexplanations">Level 1: Learning From Primary Explanations</h3>

<p>When there is an existing Scholarly or Research Literature
with Good Explanations addressing the Subject Domain,
Learning becomes a matter of</p>

<ul>
<li>Ability to Read and Understand Primary Materials</li>
<li>Familiarity with Assumed Background Knowledge</li>
<li>Critical Reading and Thinking Skills</li>
<li>Access to Experts and Peer Learners</li>
</ul>

<p>Primary materials are generally targeted at the authors&#8217;
colleagues who have extensive expertise in the subject
domain. Academic convention may result in research papers
which are unnecessarily abstract and divorced from the more
concrete models and examples which drive the researcher&#8217;s
intuitions in their discovery process. With some
exceptions, primary materials are often difficult to
comprehend without the background possessed by the small
group of researchers addressing the same problems.</p>

<p>Accessible primary (and good seconary materials discussed
below) are distinct from <em>popularizations</em> where
approximations and analogies are used as substitutes (rather
than bridges) to a complete understanding of the subject.
It&#8217;s very common for popularizations to eliminate key
mathematical parts of the best explanations. Academic
tradition disdains popularization and the reputation of
scholars who make their work more broadly accessible can
suffer if their materials appear to be popularizations.</p>

<p>Level 1 Learning requires a willingness to stop as often as
necessary to learn prerequisite materials which may include,
for example, unfamiliar areas of mathematics. Level 1
Learning is most accessible to Learners whose Love of
Learning is complemented by strong Learning Skills.</p>

<h3 id="level2:educationalmaterialsfacilitatedlearning">Level 2: Educational Materials &amp; Facilitated Learning</h3>

<p>Secondary materials and procedures are designed specifically
at educating students about a specific subject.</p>

<p>The Traditional Education Approach may use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Textbooks</li>
<li>Lectures</li>
<li>Curricula</li>
<li>Teachers</li>
</ul>

<p>The Traditional Top-Down Approach covers the material to be
learned in a Linear Progression so that all pre-requisites
are mastered sufficiently before each new topic is
presented. Planned exercises support the progression. The
students are &#8220;trained&#8221; in specific problem-solving methods
to apply to each problem to produce the (generally unique)
&#8220;correct&#8221; solution.</p>

<p>Alternatively, a Bottom-Up Educational Approach may use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interactive Workbooks &amp; Notebooks</li>
<li>Interactive Software Simulations</li>
<li>Project Groups &amp; Peer Facilitators</li>
</ul>

<p>The Traditional Top-Down Educational Approach can be very
efficient when it matches the background, learning-style and
pace of the Learner. Even when the traditional approach
seems to work well, it may suppress rather than develop the
intuitions essential to mastery and creative (generative)
expertise.</p>

<p>Bottom-Up Educational Approaches are designed to facilitate
the simultaneous growth of Learners&#8217; formal and intuitive
understanding of the material with the intuitive &#8220;Hands-On&#8221;
processes going first. These alternative approaches often
allow Learners more flexibility to set their own pace and
detailed trajectory.</p>

<p>Bottom-Up Education tries to avoid implying that there is
only one solution to any given problem and instead presents
contrasting solutions and encourages the Learner to explore
additional solutions.</p>

<h3 id="level3:proceduraltrainingforspecifictasks">Level 3: Procedural Training for Specific Tasks</h3>

<p>Industrial Training has traditionally been designed to train
Blue-Collar workers</p>

<ul>
<li>to efficiently and reliably produce</li>
<li>predictable results</li>
<li>under the direction of managers</li>
<li>using methods planned by experts</li>
</ul>

<p>Expertise and creativity and especially experimentation have
traditionally been seen as undesirable characteristics in
Blue-Collar Workers.</p>

<p>Recently, increasing computerized automation has been
reducing the demand for uncreative workers at ALL levels of
organization. It is increasingly possible to automate the
uncreative work of Workers, Managers, Planners and even
Executives.</p>

<p>The modern viewpoint, championed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming" target="_blank">Deming</a>
and others views first-tier (manufacturing and
customer-facing) workers as key experts in providing quality
of goods and services. These first-tier workers have the
greatest opportunity to see what works and doesn&#8217;t work and
how processes can be improved. Innovative approaches such
as quality circles were designed to utilize this expertise,
both for immediate application
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_improvement" target="_blank">continuous improvement</a>)
and also to communicate it up the chain-of-command, leading
to what is sometimes called a &#8220;inverted&#8221; hierarchy,
i.e. where managers work FOR the first-tier workers, helping
them do their job best, and providing two-way communication
with the rest of the enterprise.</p>

<p>Modern education systems arose, grew and took their current
form during the pre-modern industrialization era, which was
also a time when most if not all large societies had a very
rigid class structure. We can easily see that much of the
structure of our educational institutions and the way we
think about education (our <a href="loel-paradigms.html">Educational Paradigms</a>) are not well
adapted to current needs. While nearly everyone admits that
our educational system is in crisis, our institutions and
unconscious assumptions (those pesky paradigms again) resist
even well-proven advancements.</p>

<h2 id="learningcanbeconsciousorunconscious">Learning can be Conscious or Unconscious</h2>

<p>First, an extended example, please read this first:</p>

<h3 id="learningnewforeignhumanlanguages">Learning New (Foreign) Human Languages</h3>

<p>Linguists now know a great deal about the structure of human
language. Linguists have built mathematical and
computational models which can, respectively represent and
perform much of the processes involved in human language
understanding and generation. Despite great progress, the
best linguistic models fail to account for the fluency of
native speakers of any human language.</p>

<p>Traditional language teaching in schools is done in a
top-down mode where the teacher has students consciously
memorize words and rules and apply that knowledge to
understanding and speaking the new language. Most students
find the process difficult and distasteful, dropping out if
they can. The students who complete the program are
&#8220;proficient&#8221; but almost never fluent. As an example,
schools in Japan and France require seven years of this kind
of study of English, yet the results are far from
impressive.</p>

<p>There are two problems with the traditional approach:</p>

<p>(1) Since even professional linguists do not know the rules
which native speakers follow, it is impossible for teachers
to train anyone to follow them!</p>

<p>(2) Conscious processes are severely constrained by limited
cognitive resources. Unconscious processes have access to
the brain&#8217;s massive resources of pattern-associative memory
and parallel distributed processing. Native speakers
acquire and exhibit nearly perfect intuitions and
performance in a short period of time through exploiting
natural, largely unconscious learning processes.</p>

<p>It is often said that learning human languages well requires
special resources present only in the young. However,
educational programs based on immersion have shown that
adults can become fluent in new languages just as quickly as or
even more quickly than children do; when the immersion is
managed properly fluency can be achieved in one school year
with no more time than is usually allocated to a single
subject.</p>

<p>Learning a human language is an Interest-Directed process
which can be &#8220;facilitated&#8221; and &#8220;coached&#8221; but not well
&#8220;taught&#8221;, i.e. it can be optimized by a well-designed
immersion, exposure and engagement process.</p>

<p>Linear, conscious attention during the early phases of
Language Learning can be harmful as it inhibits the
acquisition of the language intuitions which underlie
fluency.</p>
</div>

<hr />
<div class="cols" >

<h3 id="okhowdoesthisapplytoothersubjects">OK, How does this apply to other Subjects?</h3>

<p>Many key intellectual skills work best when mostly
performed by unconscious and automatic processes, e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>(first-draft) Writing</li>
<li>Mathematical Intuition</li>
<li>Physical Intuition</li>
<li>Social Intuition</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, despite massive research investments, our best
scientific models and computer simulations of all of these
skills fall far short of human ability.</p>

<p>The highest levels of expertise and mastery in most areas
involve a small amount of Conscious Awareness organizing a
larger amount of intuitive and automatic skill.</p>

<p>If these highest levels of expertise and mastery are to be
available to more Learners, the learning process must
facilitate rather than suppress the development of
foundational intuition. Formal, conscious understanding
will aid the learning process when it follows rather than
leads intuitive understanding. The Learner can tell the
difference: Rules which align and organize intuitive
understanding give an &#8220;A-HA&#8221; response and &#8220;click in&#8221;.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert" target="_blank">Seymour Papert</a>
made an explicit analogy between learning languages and
mathematics when he said &#8220;What would happen if children who
can’t do math grew up in
<a href="https://vimeo.com/44907186" target="_blank">Mathland</a>, a place that is to
math what France is to French?&#8221; &quot;</p>
</div>

<div class="cols" >

<h2 id="learningcanbeopenorclosed">Learning can be Open or Closed</h2>

<p>Most of what we know we learned without conscious direction,
through immersion in the world and in our social surround.
Although the skills we acquired in this natural process of
engagement are our highest, our most fluent skills, if they
remain unconscious they will never go anywhere, they are
Closed.</p>

<p>Most of what is taught, consciously and successfully in
school fails to engage long-term interest in the students.
It is either soon forgotten or is applied in rote fashion
when needed, rather than vigorously expanded upon. When the
student&#8217;s interest is not engaged the learning is, once
again, Closed.</p>

<p>Closed Learning reaches some level and then stops. It
ossifies, becoming less and less likely to be built-upon as
time goes on.</p>

<p>Open Learning is driven by curiosity, often in periods of
almost obsessive concentration. Open Learning is driven by
a desire for depth and breadth as well as connection and
integration with everything else in the learner&#8217;s world and
existing knowledge. If it stops, then it becomes Closed and
ossifies. Ideally, Open Learning is never completed;
obsessive interest dies down to a more moderate level after
a few months and becomes integrated into the Learner&#8217;s more
general interests.</p>

<p>The biggest criticism which can be leveled at the current
way education operates in our modern societies is that it
discourages Open Learning and the Love of Learning in most
young people.</p>

<p>The ability of a few Learners to come out of their formative
years with their Curiosity and Love of Learning in good
shape is a wonderful fact about human diversity. Like IQ, it
speaks to some important characteristics of individuals. That
some Learners will do well even when everything is against
them (not <em>because</em> everything is against them) says
little about what we should be doing to support Learners in general.</p>

<p>Here and there we are able to observe groups of Learners
almost all of whom do extremely well, because of a special
teacher or an alternative educational process. It is a sad
fact that our existing educational systems actively avoid
being informed by these successes. We can do better than
that.</p>

<p>We know that there are processes which result in nearly all
young people emerging from childhood with</p>

<ul>
<li>an excellent general education</li>
<li>a love of learning along with good learning skills</li>
<li>adult-level expertise in their area(s) of passion</li>
<li>a guarantee of future success</li>
</ul>

<p>This should be the birthright of all human beings. It
is our job to make it so. Any program of &#8220;education&#8221; which
does not have this as its ultimate aim is misdirected.</p>
