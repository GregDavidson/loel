Status: DRAFT
This page is part materials for the League Of Extraordinary Learners Website. When
our official Website goes live, these materials will be accompanied by some
videos produced by the Foundation introducing the Vision and Mission of the
Foundation along with extensive On-Line Educational Resources.
***** What is LOEL? *****
The League of Extraordinary Learners, LOEL, is a Learning Community of people who love to learn and who support one another in their learning
activities.
The League consists of
    * Learners persuing their love of learning
    * Peer Facilitators assisting their peers with material they themselves
      have recently learned
    * Subject Experts & Learning Mentors
    * Supporters of LOEL and LOEL’s Learners
**** Are you a Learner? ****
A Learner is someone who loves learning. Learners typically
    * Are fascinated by one or more subject areas
    * Love reading and exploring their areas of interest
    * Are eager to expand their Learning and Thinking skills
While the terms Learner and Student are partially synonymous, Student tends to
imply someone following a specific progarm controlled by an Educational
Institution. We use the term Learner to mean someone who is pursuing their
interests without or beyond the scope of any official program.
**** Are you an Extraordinary Learner? ****
An Extraordinary Learner Possesses
    * abundant curiosity & exuberance,
    * flexibility & resilience,
    * a drive to learn and grow.
While these characteristics are typical of young people, youthful older people
share the same characteristics.
The League is especially welcoming to young people and extends that welcome to
youthful older people - as long as they are well behaved ☺.
Who do you know who might be an Extraordinary Learner?

===============================================================================
***** How does the League support You and Other Extraordinary Learners? *****
Extraordinary Learners do not wait for teachers, they actively seek information
and knowledge about their areas of interest. Modern Learners spend a lot of
time browsing the Web, e.g. reading Wikipedia Articles, viewing TED talks, etc.
Learners seek the best learning materials. Challenging material is sometimes
learned best with the support of other Learners, Peer Facilitators, Experts and
Mentors. Collaborative Projects can be helpful for some kinds of Learning.
Members of the League support one another in finding
    * The best Learning Materials for any Subject
    * Fellow Learners for Study Groups and collaborative Projects
    * Peer Facilitators who have recently learned the same Subjects
    * Expert Mentors who can back up the Peer Facilitators
**** We operate Strategically ****
We are careful to never stand between a Learner and their interests: the
Learner is always the active agent in their education. We stand to the side and
help make the resources which they need more available.
Much of the necessary resources already exist freely on the web but there are
gaps. We will cause the creation or adaptation of
    * Directories of available material
    * Syllabi of organized courses of study
    * Materials for carrying out Hands-On Projects
    * Communication tools for
          o Participating in Group Projects
          o Interaction with Peer Facilitators and Mentors
    * Self-tests and other coverage metrics
    * Additional and improved material of all kinds
It is our thesis that the best peers and mentors for supporting the Learners
are some of the other Learners who have recently completed a given course of
study. We will call these graduates “Peer Facilitators”. We also believe that
to the greatest extent possible, the Learners and the Peer Facilitators are the
best creators of improved and missing materials, both during and soon after
their experience with a course of study.

===============================================================================
***** Learning in the Real World *****
Resources for a good education need to include more than excellent educational
study materials. Much of the learning should be done as part of Hands-On
Projects, often with Groups of Learners, dealing with the challenges of
accomplishing results in the real world. Our partnership will empower and
enable the Learners and Peer Facilitators to create and participate in a large
variety of such projects.
We will encourage Learners in the same geographic area to create or join a LOEL
Chapter and utilize local support to create and participate in
    * Weekend and Summer Intensives
    * Tech Shops, Maker Spaces, etc.
A LOEL Chapter will typically be small enough that its Learners can get to know
one another. Some LOEL Chapters will be organized Geographically, e.g. San
Diego LOEL or Mumbai LOEL; others will likely be Internet Based groups focused
on common interests.
We also encourage and support Learners in acquiring the interpersonal
communication and collaboration skills needed for success in carrying out large
projects and in working effectively in large organizations such as Universities
and Corporations.
