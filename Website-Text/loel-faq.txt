  Status
      EARLY DRAFT
This is a Work-In-Progress!
***** Who Are Our Resources For? *****
**** We Directly Target Learners ****
LOEL directly targets its programs to Learners i.e. people with strong
interests in learning challenging material extending beyond what might be
supported by any educational institution in which they might be enrolled. We
especially wish to support those interested in and engaged in learning the
often challenging STEM subjects - Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics. However, we are not limiting our support to STEM subjects.
We assume that LOEL Learners are already browsing the Internet looking for
resources to satisfy their interests and curiosity. Our job is to assist them
in locating and successfully employing such resources, including assisting them
in finding peers and mentors and helping them manage their learning process. It
is also our job to make it possible for Learners to contribute to one another’s
success.
**** Why Say “Learners” Rather Than “Students” ****
The term “Student” emphasizes a person as occupying a role within an Education
Institution. Typically a Student is pursuing a Course Of Study defined by the
Institution rather than the Student’s own interests. Extraordinary Learners tend to
be people whose curiosity and interest in learning goes beyond the scope
of institutional programs. We emphasize this vital difference when we call such
Students “Learners”.
**** How can Adults support Younger Learners? ****
Adults are, of course, welcome to use our materials in their own Learning.
In addition we welcome Adult Partners who can participate as
    * Mentors in areas where they have expertise
    * Contributors to our materials
    * Volunteer Staff
    * Fundraisers
    * Etc.
**** What about Educational Institutions and Networks? ****
LOEL designs its materials to be useful to Learners whether they are enrolled
as Students in
    * Conventional Schools
          o Primary and Secondary Schools
          o Colleges, Universities, Professional Schools, etc.
    * Alternative Schools
          o Magnet, Montessori, Waldorf, etc.
    * Alternative Educational Programs
          o e.g. Homeschooling Networks
    * or none of the above!
We welcome the use of our resources by the faculty or administrators of any
educational programs for the benefit of their Students and we consider it to be
their job to adapt our materials as needed to fit into their curriculum and
classrooms and to satisfy any of their institutional requirements in regard to
using our materials.
We welcome the support of administrators, teachers, professors, etc. as Adult
Partners.
**** What about Colleges, Universities and Professional Schools? ****
Colleges, Universities and Professional Schools offer valuable educational
programs and credentials. While these programs are increasingly available in
the form of on-line materials and on-line courses and prestigious credentials
can increasingly be earned through on-line study as well, there remain decided
advantages for Learners to participate in programs of these kinds of
Institutions, especially strong 4-year programs and most especially Graduate
School.
We encourage and support our Learners to enroll in any College, University or
Professional School programs which will advance their educational and/or career
goals.
Our primary relationship with Colleges and Universities is to ensure that our
Learners
    * have a solid college-preparatory education
          o including passing on-line versions of many courses
    * will be able to present very strong applications, including
          o high scores on entrance exams
          o records of impressive accomplishments
          o strong recommendations from recognized experts
    * will be first in line for programs such as
          o scholarships, fellowships, work-study programs, etc.
          o which do NOT incur student debt
    * are supported, while in college by our
          o network of fellow Learners, Peers, Mentors, etc.
          o resources related to their courses of study
We welcome the support of Institutional Faculty, Assistants and Administrators
as Adult Partners.
**** What About the Parents of Young Extraordinary Learners? ****
We welcome the participation of Learners’ Families and Adult Family Friends in
our programs as we welcome all Adult Partners. Adult Family and Family Friends
can have a strong positive impact on the success of younger Extraordinary Learners.
In some cases Family and Friends can present obstacles to a younger Extraordinary Learner’s
success. We suggest materials_in_our_Educational_Resource_Map which directly
address some of these issues.
***** Summer Camps and other Intensive Programs *****
**** What is our relationship with Local Intensive Programs? ****
Gathering a medium to large collection of Learners in the same place for an
intensive program can be extremely valuable for Learners. Although such
programs are not our primary focus we strongly approve of them and are
supportive of them in our own way.
We exist to contribute to all STEM Learners which definitely includes the STEM
Learners who are participating in any Local Intensive Programs. The people
running such programs might easily become official Partners in our
organization, especially if they follow the Learning Partnership Model.
We are happy to list local programs in our Resource Directory and help make
sure that our Learners, Peers and Other Partners in that local area are aware
of them.
Our on-line resources are available for use in Local Programs, just as they are
available for Institutions.
To the extent that a group of Local Programs follow a Partnership Model similar
to ours with “Learners”, “Peers” and “Others” offering facilitation, improving
course materials, allowing Learners to become Peers, etc. we embrace their
partnership.
**** Why Don’t We Create and Sponsor Local Programs? ****
Nearly all successful educational programs in the Past have been tied to a
specific institution or local project.
Today the single biggest opportunity for impacting the maximum numbers of
Learners is operating effectively via the Internet.
We believe that Local Programs are best created and maintained by committed
people in that locality. Participants in those programs get the benefit of
local support and addition they can participate fully in any and all Internet-
Based programs such as those offered by the LOEL.
Local Short-Term Intensive Programs such as Summer Camps, Science Fairs, etc.
have special need of the support of LOEL Programs since when their Intensive is
over the Learners may be left without the continuing support needed to utilize
the gains from their participation in their intensive program.
