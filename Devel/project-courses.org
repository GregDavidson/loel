* Project Courses of the League of Extraordinary Learners

A [[file:../../README.org][LOEL]] Project Course is generally part of a [[file:creating-curricula.org][LOEL Curriculum]].

A Project Course has
- A Project which is
      - Interesting to Multiple Participants
      - A Meaningful Contribution to a Community or the World
      - A vehicle for increasing Mastery in an Area of Interest
            - typically the Area related to the associated Curriculum

For a Project Course to function as a LOEL Curriculum it needs
- Materials for Participants to onboard themselves
- Peer Facilitators who are already onboard
- Experts providing Backup

A LOEL Project Course is similar to a [[https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/][Google Summer of Code]] Project
- except that it is
      - generally unfunded
      - not necessarily tied to a specific time, e.g. Summer

Generally, materials worked on and developed in a LOEL Project Course will be
Open Source licensed and the expertise gained by the participants will be
reflected in their increase of general practical skills along with being able to
leverage the materials of the project in other endeavors.
