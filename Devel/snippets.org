Human beings are Extraordinary Learners. Maria Montessori said that children are
better at learning than teachers are at teaching. Children have a great capacity
for learning whatever is interesting to them - not necessarily what some adults
would prefer them to be learning. Humans at all ages can expand and develop
their curiosity along with the scope of their interests and their capacity for
learning to an extraordinary degree.
