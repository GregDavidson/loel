Some Caveats
- We will need you make your changes freely shareable so we can use them
      - /Details on License Assignment Needed Here!/
- Your vision and ours may differ
      - Before doing a lot of work, communicate!
      - Posting Issues first before creating major work is wise!
      - Fixing typos, broken links, out-of-date information and other obvious
        infelicities is very welcome, so please go ahead with such!!

* Our Favorite Development Tools

Note: Most of our documents are [[https://orgmode.org][OrgMode]] text files. They can be edited online
with any text editor or online with GitHub. With OrgMode-aware editors such as
[[https://github.com/GregDavidson/computing-magic/blob/main/Software-Tools/Emacs/emacs-readme.org][Emacs]], these documents come alive!

Emacs, OrgMode and Git are helping us be highly productive in developing and
maintaining LOEL resources. They're worth learning for this and other purposes,
but they are not immediately intuitive, so we have materials to help!.

We invite you to use [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/computing-magic/tree/main/Modules/Module-2#readme][Module 2]] of our [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/computing-magic#readme][Computing Magic Curriculum]] to help you
*learn and get productive with*
- *Git, GitHub and Emacs*
Please let us know how we can improve that material!
