* Creating and Developing LOEL Resource Directories

The [[file:../README.org][League of Extraordinary Learners]] develops materials and programs to assist
curious learners in their learning enterprises. The simplest of these resources
is simply a list of Resources, but not just any list.

A LOEL Resource Directory is
- a curated list of the best resources we know to facilitate
  learning a given subject

We prioritize resources which are
- /Learner Centric/
- more bottom-up than top-down
- flexible and self-paced
      - providing multiple paths and optional elements
- incorporating feedback and self-assessment components
- a synergistic mix of theory and practice
- designed to creating competence and then mastery
      - creating a platform for further learning
      - part of exponential life-long learning
- [[file:../Short-Works/open-content.org][Open Content]]
      - freely shareable
      - and ideally freely modifiable!

- are a related concept
- which we can link to and borrow from!

Evolution of LOEL Resource Directories
- Often grow into Courses, Curricula, etc.
- Generally become part of those more elaborate Resources

When you recommend a resource, please state
- which of our prioritization criteria (listed above) it satisfies
- how you used it and why you like it
- which learners you think would most benefit from it
- how lengthy it is, e.g.
      - if it's to read, how long is it in pages or words?
      - if it's a linear medium, how long to watch or listen to it?
      - is it easy to evaluate for use?
            - e.g. having a good overview/introduction, Table of Contents, etc.
            - if not, would you supply that overview?

- an interesting suggestion from the awesome [[https://www.lesswrong.com/][LessWrong]] community
- not required for LOEL but definitely a good idea!
      - see our prioritization criteria listed above
      - let nothing stop you from recommending your favorite resources!

All LOEL materials and programs exist and improve by the participation of people like you.
- While LOEL is hosted on Github, please assist by
      - Submitting Issues for improvement
      - Cloning our repositories, improving them and submitting pull requests!
