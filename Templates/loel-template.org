This curriculum is under continuous development by its participants!

** TL;DR [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/loel/blob/main/Gloss/tldr.org][/What does TL;DR mean?/]]

If you want to skip some of the reading, go right to section /XXX/ below.

**  [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/loel/blob/main/Gloss/tldr.org][TL;DR]]

Alternative TL;DR header line.

For pages deeper in the repository where readers have likely already seen the
TL;DR acronym, we can simplify the TL;DR header line with an embedded link.

** GitHub Limited OrgMode Support

GitHub only offers partial support for OrgMode documents, including features
which are important for LOEL.
- References to links within documents don't work
- Folding and Unfolding doesn't work
      - Drawers are always visible
- Etc.

We could use GitHub Markdown instead, but
- Markdown doesn't offer most of the needed features!

** TODO OrgMode --> HTML

Regular HTML Web Pages are better for online reading of LOEL materials.
- OrgMode can export to HTML
- PanDoc can convert OrgMode to HTML

Be default, that HTML won't support /Folding and Unfolding/
- We can fix this with some CSS!

TODO:
- Improve LOEL CSS and JavaScript to accompany Web Pages created from our
  OrgMode sources
- Establish and document best practices in translating our OrgMode sources to
  HTML.
