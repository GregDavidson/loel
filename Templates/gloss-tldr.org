* TL;DR - Too Long; Didn't Read

A TL;DR section is used to give you a *workable alternative to doing a lot of
reading*.  Workable, but maybe not as good.

If you're in the mood to read a bit more, you'll likely find that
the text you'll /could/ skip is
- *Useful Context*
even if it says
- Introduction, Background, etc.

There's also a lot to be said for diving in faster, though!
