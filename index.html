<p>This is now an historical document. Current development is happening at</p>
<ul>
    <li>

<p>This page provides an overview of and links to materials for the League Of
Extraordinary Learners Website. When our official Website goes live, these
materials will be accompanied by some videos produced by the Foundation
introducing the Vision and Mission of the Foundation along with extensive
On-Line Educational Resources.</p>

<h2 id="whatisloel">What is LOEL?</h2>

<p>The League of Extraordinary Learners, LOEL, is a Learning
Community of people who love to learn and
who support one another in their learning activities.</p>

<p>The League consists of</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Learners</em> persuing their love of learning</li>
<li><em>Peer Facilitators</em> assisting their peers with material they themselves have recently learned</li>
<li><em>Subject Experts</em> &amp; <em>Learning Mentors</em></li>
<li><em>Supporters</em> of LOEL and LOEL's Learners</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="areyoualearner">Are you a Learner?</h3>

<p>A Learner is someone who loves learning. Learners typically</p>

<ul>
<li>Are fascinated by one or more subject areas</li>
<li>Love reading and exploring their areas of interest</li>
<li>Are eager to expand their Learning and Thinking skills</li>
</ul>

<p>While the terms <em>Learner</em> and <em>Student</em> are partially
synonymous, <em>Student</em> tends to imply someone following a
specific progarm controlled by an <em>Educational Institution</em>.
We use the term <em>Learner</em> to mean someone who is pursuing
their interests without or beyond the scope of any official
program.</p>

<h3 id="areyouanextraordinarylearner">Are you an Extraordinary Learner?</h3>

<p>Extraordinary Learners possess</p>

<ul>
<li>abundant curiosity &amp; exuberance,</li>
<li>flexibility &amp; resilience,</li>
<li>a drive to learn and grow.</li>
</ul>

<p>While these characteristics are typical of young people,
youthful older people often share the same characteristics.</p>

<p>The League is especially welcoming to young people and
extends that welcome to youthful older people - as long as
they are well behaved &#9786;.</p>

<p>Who do you know who might be an Extraordinary Learner?</p>

<h2 id="howdoestheleaguesupportyouandotherextraordinarylearners">How does the League support You and Other Extraordinary Learners?</h2>

<p>Extraordinary Learners do not wait for teachers, they
actively seek information and knowledge about their areas of
interest. Modern Learners spend a lot of time browsing the
Web, e.g. reading Wikipedia Articles, viewing TED talks,
etc. Learners seek the <em>best learning materials</em>.
Challenging material is sometimes learned best with the
support of other Learners, Peer Facilitators, Experts and
Mentors. Collaborative Projects can be helpful for some
kinds of Learning.</p>

<p>Members of the League support one another in finding</p>

<ul>
<li>The best Learning Materials for any Subject</li>
<li>Fellow Learners for Study Groups and collaborative Projects</li>
<li>Peer Facilitators who have recently learned the same Subjects</li>
<li>Expert Mentors who can back up the Peer Facilitators</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="weoperatestrategically">We operate Strategically</h3>

<p>We are careful to never stand between a <em>Learner</em> and their
interests: the <em>Learner</em> is always the active agent in their
education. We stand to the side and help make the resources
which they need more available.</p>

<p>Much of the necessary resources already exist freely on the
web but there are gaps. We will cause the creation or
adaptation of</p>

<ul>
<li>Directories of available material</li>
<li>Syllabi of organized courses of study</li>
<li>Materials for carrying out Hands-On Projects</li>
<li>Communication tools for

<ul>
<li>Participating in Group Projects</li>
<li>Interaction with Peer Facilitators and Mentors</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Self-tests and other coverage metrics</li>
<li>Additional and improved material of all kinds</li>
</ul>

<p>It is our thesis that the best peers and mentors for
supporting the Learners are some of
the other Learners who have recently completed a
given course of study. We will call these graduates
&#8220;Peer Facilitators&#8221;. We also believe that to the greatest extent
possible, the Learners and the Peer Facilitators are the best creators of
improved and missing materials, both during and soon after
their experience with a course of study.</p>

<h2 id="learningintherealworld">Learning in the Real World</h2>

<p>Resources for a good education need to include more than
excellent educational study materials. Much of the learning
should be done as part of Hands-On Projects, often with
Groups of Learners, dealing with the challenges of
accomplishing results in the real world. Our partnership
will empower and enable the Learners and Peer Facilitators
to create and participate in a large variety of such
projects.</p>

<p>We will encourage Learners in the same geographic area to
create or join a LOEL Chapter and utilize local support to
create and participate in</p>

<ul>
<li>Weekend and Summer Intensives</li>
<li>Tech Shops, Maker Spaces, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>A LOEL Chapter will typically be small enough that its
Learners can get to know one another. Some LOEL Chapters
will be organized Geographically, e.g. San Diego LOEL or
Mumbai LOEL; others will likely be Internet Based groups
focused on common interests.</p>

<p>We also encourage and support Learners in acquiring the
interpersonal communication and collaboration skills needed
for success in carrying out large projects and in working
effectively in large organizations such as Universities and
Corporations.</p>

<p>As an important contextual background for our projects, we
recommend that you watch these two 10-minute videos prepared
by the (British) Royal Society for the Arts:</p>
