  Status
      VERY EARLY DRAFT
This is a Work-In-Progress! It needs to gloss all of the terms and principles
which appear in the other materials.
***** Learning Partnership Model *****
In the Learning Partnership Model Learners, Graduates and committed Other
Partners are encouraged to participate fully in the ongoing development and
improvement of all Learning Programs and Materials. All the materials and the
design of all programs is freely offered to any other Learners or groups
running educational programs provided they give back their improvements to the
community at large. (Share and Share-Alike principle).

***** Keller Plan aka Mastery System aka PSI *****
In the Keller Plan material to be learned is divided into modules of related
material which are
    * organized according to pre-requisites
    * accompanied by
          o a variety of study materials (texts, multimedia, etc.)
          o Homework or Hands-On Projects
          o rigorous self-tests
Keller Plan study is normally
    * pursued by a collaborative group
    * self-paced or group-paced
Keller Plan courses may have optional and alternative modules and allow many
different paths for individuals and groups.
A module or course is only passed if all Learners have mastered all of its core
distinctions.
***** Collaborative Learning *****
***** Immersion Learning *****
***** Intensive Short Courses *****
Learning Tree’s intensive Hands-On Courses are an excellent example of the
efficiency and power of Intensive Short Courses.
Intensive Short Courses are primarily of value when the material learned
    * is a prerequisite for urgent projects
    * will be immediately and extensively applied right away
***** MIT Logo and Xerox Smalltalk *****
The best STEM-oriented programs I am aware of that have produced excellent
results with middle-school aged Learners have been the ones operated by Xerox
PARC oriented around the Smalltalk environment and those at MIT oriented around
Pappert’s LOGO system and Negroponte’s One Laptop per Child projects.
All three of these projects use the principle of immersing the young person in
an environment in which the mathematical and physical material to be learned
was directly observable and manipulable. Rather than trying to micromanage what
the Learners were to do with the material the project staff got the Learners to
create interesting collaborative projects and then stepped back into the role
of peers and mentors. The result of this approach was that the Learners wound
up going very far and fast with their learning and wound up with a solid
practical ownership of both the abstract material and the technology.
***** UCSD Computer Science Keller Plan *****
The project I know best borrowed many of the best ideas from (1) Xerox PARC’s
Smalltalk Project, (2) MIT’s LOGO project along with (3) the mastery-oriented
technology of the Keller Plan plus (4) one more key ingredient I’ll mention in
a moment. That project was the UCSD P-System Project which was responsible for
introducing all entering UCSD students in the basics of Computer Science up to
writing complex custom programs of their own design. Although the Students in
our program were just out of high school, I believe that everything we did
would have worked similarly with middle school or high school aged Students.
The additional key ingredient in our UCSD project was creating a path allowing
and encouraging the Students to take increasing leadership roles in the
project, beginning with assisting in the lab, then contributing materials and
finally becoming full-fledged project members. In this way one professor, Ken
Bowles, was able to manage a program that simultaneously trained thousands of
students every year (with unprecedented academic success) and which also
developed a complete operating system and complete set of software tools more
advanced than any then available on microcomputers.
My experience of bright young Learners is that when they are motivated they can
learn a lot faster than conventional instruction can spoon-feed them. I believe
that our best approach to empowering Learners is to leverage their passion for
learning and their natural orientation towards self-direction by getting them
invovled in collaborative projects which give them room to learn at their
maximum rate using materials and technology they can use ongoingly. Our best
role is in the training of peers and mentors, which will eventually largely
consist of the graduates of our programs. We should also make maximum use of
the amazing range of exisiting materials which are now available through the
Internet and engage the Learners in projects which adapt and improve those
materials based on their experience. I think that this kind of approach will
maximize the future success of our Learners!

***** Sojourner Mentality *****
***** Getting oneself out of the middle *****
The originator:
    * Holds the initial Vision
    * Drives the enterprise
    * Gets things started
    * Works to achieve “liftoff”
If the originator holds onto control after liftoff:
The originator:
    * target of all resistance/pushback
    * overwhelmed by increasing issues
    * growth limited by capacity of an individual
    * either burns out or has to strangle the enterprise
The master originator:
    * Always looking to give tasks away
    * Seeks to get him/herself out of the middle
    * Re-injects the vision as necessary
    * Becomes a resource rather than a limiting factor
