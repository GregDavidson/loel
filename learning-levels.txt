****** Levels of Learning ******
***** Learning Takes Place at Many Levels *****
There are a number of ways of characterizing different kinds of learning. For
simplicity we’ll introduce four different “Levels”:
    * Level 0: Learning Without Existing Explanations
    * Level 1: Learning From Primary Explanations
    * Level 2: Educational Materials & Facilitated Learning
    * Level 3: Procedural Training for Specific Tasks
We also want to introduce two different “Modes”:
    * Top-Down: Something other than the Learner’s interest is directing the
      process
    * Interest-Directed: The learner’s interest is directing the process
We claim that the most powerful Learning is in the “Interest-Directed” modes of
Levels 0, 1 and 2. In the United States and many other countries, primary,
secondary and undergraduate college education systems mostly use the Top-Down
modes of Level 2. Trade Schools and other vocational programs mostly use the
Top-Down modes of Level 3.
Each of these Levels can be used successfully in some circumstances. Our claims
are that (1) some of these Levels are over-used, (2) the Top-Down mode is over-
used and (3) there are alternatives to the traditional and most common
approaches that can be much more effective!
**** Level 0: Learning Without Existing Explanations ****
Human curiosity often brings us face-to-face with questions, known to
researchers as problems, where there are not yet any organized and accepted
answers or explanations.
The processes of Science, Mathematics and Creative Engineering all require
Level 0 Learning. The Learner is in a direct relationship with Physics, Logic
and Pragmatic Possibility.
Level 0 Learning generally benefits from, but can also be hindered by
    * Interaction with Colleagues
    * Speculative and Fragmentary Explanations
    * Analogies with Similar Problems with More Mature Explanations
    * Facility with the Discovery Processes of their Discipline
Nearly everything we learned as children is also Level 0 learning, including
our fluency in our native language(s). More will be said about this below!
===============================================================================
**** Level 1: Learning From Primary Explanations ****
When there is an existing Scholarly or Research Literature with Good
Explanations addressing the Subject Domain, Learning becomes a matter of
    * Ability to Read and Understand Primary Materials
    * Familiarity with Assumed Background Knowledge
    * Critical Reading and Thinking Skills
    * Access to Experts and Peer Learners
Primary materials are generally targeted at the authors’ colleagues who have
extensive expertise in the subject domain. Academic convention may result in
research papers which are unnecessarily abstract and divorced from the more
concrete models and examples which drive the researcher’s intuitions in their
discovery process. With some exceptions, primary materials are often difficult
to comprehend without the background possessed by the small group of
researchers addressing the same problems.
Accessible primary (and good seconary materials discussed below) are distinct
from popularizations where approximations and analogies are used as substitutes
(rather than bridges) to a complete understanding of the subject. It’s very
common for popularizations to eliminate key mathematical parts of the best
explanations. Academic tradition disdains popularization and the reputation of
scholars who make their work more broadly accessible can suffer if their
materials appear to be popularizations.
Level 1 Learning requires a willingness to stop as often as necessary to learn
prerequisite materials which may include, for example, unfamiliar areas of
mathematics. Level 1 Learning is most accessible to Learners whose Love of
Learning is complemented by strong Learning Skills.
===============================================================================
**** Level 2: Educational Materials & Facilitated Learning ****
Secondary materials and procedures are designed specifically at educating
students about a specific subject.
The Traditional Education Approach may use:
    * Textbooks
    * Lectures
    * Curricula
    * Teachers
The Traditional Top-Down Approach covers the material to be learned in a Linear
Progression so that all pre-requisites are mastered sufficiently before each
new topic is presented. Planned exercises support the progression. The students
are “trained” in specific problem-solving methods to apply to each problem to
produce the (generally unique) “correct” solution.
Alternatively, a Bottom-Up Educational Approach may use:
    * Interactive Workbooks & Notebooks
    * Interactive Software Simulations
    * Project Groups & Peer Facilitators
The Traditional Top-Down Educational Approach can be very efficient when it
matches the background, learning-style and pace of the Learner. Even when the
traditional approach seems to work well, it may suppress rather than develop
the intuitions essential to mastery and creative (generative) expertise.
Bottom-Up Educational Approaches are designed to facilitate the simultaneous
growth of Learners’ formal and intuitive understanding of the material with the
intuitive “Hands-On” processes going first. These alternative approaches often
allow Learners more flexibility to set their own pace and detailed trajectory.
Bottom-Up Education tries to avoid implying that there is only one solution to
any given problem and instead presents contrasting solutions and encourages the
Learner to explore additional solutions.
===============================================================================
**** Level 3: Procedural Training for Specific Tasks ****
Industrial Training has traditionally been designed to train Blue-Collar
workers
    * to efficiently and reliably produce
    * predictable results
    * under the direction of managers
    * using methods planned by experts
Expertise and creativity and especially experimentation have traditionally been
seen as undesirable characteristics in Blue-Collar Workers.
Recently, increasing computerized automation has been reducing the demand for
uncreative workers at ALL levels of organization. It is increasingly possible
to automate the uncreative work of Workers, Managers, Planners and even
Executives.
The modern viewpoint, championed by Deming and others views first-tier
(manufacturing and customer-facing) workers as key experts in providing quality
of goods and services. These first-tier workers have the greatest opportunity
to see what works and doesn’t work and how processes can be improved.
Innovative approaches such as quality circles were designed to utilize this
expertise, both for immediate application (continuous_improvement) and also to
communicate it up the chain-of-command, leading to what is sometimes called a
“inverted” hierarchy, i.e. where managers work FOR the first-tier workers,
helping them do their job best, and providing two-way communication with the
rest of the enterprise.
Modern education systems arose, grew and took their current form during the
pre-modern industrialization era, which was also a time when most if not all
large societies had a very rigid class structure. We can easily see that much
of the structure of our educational institutions and the way we think about
education (our Educational_Paradigms) are not well adapted to current needs.
While nearly everyone admits that our educational system is in crisis, our
institutions and unconscious assumptions (those pesky paradigms again) resist
even well-proven advancements.
===============================================================================
***** Learning can be Conscious or Unconscious *****
First, an extended example, please read this first:
**** Learning New (Foreign) Human Languages ****
Linguists now know a great deal about the structure of human language.
Linguists have built mathematical and computational models which can,
respectively represent and perform much of the processes involved in human
language understanding and generation. Despite great progress, the best
linguistic models fail to account for the fluency of native speakers of any
human language.
Traditional language teaching in schools is done in a top-down mode where the
teacher has students consciously memorize words and rules and apply that
knowledge to understanding and speaking the new language. Most students find
the process difficult and distasteful, dropping out if they can. The students
who complete the program are “proficient” but almost never fluent. As an
example, schools in Japan and France require seven years of this kind of study
of English, yet the results are far from impressive.
There are two problems with the traditional approach:
(1) Since even professional linguists do not know the rules which native
speakers follow, it is impossible for teachers to train anyone to follow them!
(2) Conscious processes are severely constrained by limited cognitive
resources. Unconscious processes have access to the brain’s massive resources
of pattern-associative memory and parallel distributed processing. Native
speakers acquire and exhibit nearly perfect intuitions and performance in a
short period of time through exploiting natural, largely unconscious learning
processes.
It is often said that learning human languages well requires special resources
present only in the young. However, educational programs based on immersion
have shown that adults can become fluent in new languages just as quickly as or
even more quickly than children do; when the immersion is managed properly
fluency can be achieved in one school year with no more time than is usually
allocated to a single subject.
Learning a human language is an Interest-Directed process which can be
“facilitated” and “coached” but not well “taught”, i.e. it can be optimized by
a well-designed immersion, exposure and engagement process.
Linear, conscious attention during the early phases of Language Learning can be
harmful as it inhibits the acquisition of the language intuitions which
underlie fluency.
===============================================================================
**** OK, How does this apply to other Subjects? ****
Many key intellectual skills work best when mostly performed by unconscious and
automatic processes, e.g.
    * Reading
    * (first-draft) Writing
    * Mathematical Intuition
    * Physical Intuition
    * Social Intuition
Again, despite massive research investments, our best scientific models and
computer simulations of all of these skills fall far short of human ability.
The highest levels of expertise and mastery in most areas involve a small
amount of Conscious Awareness organizing a larger amount of intuitive and
automatic skill.
If these highest levels of expertise and mastery are to be available to more
Learners, the learning process must facilitate rather than suppress the
development of foundational intuition. Formal, conscious understanding will aid
the learning process when it follows rather than leads intuitive understanding.
The Learner can tell the difference: Rules which align and organize intuitive
understanding give an “A-HA” response and “click in”.
Seymour_Papert made an explicit analogy between learning languages and
mathematics when he said “What would happen if children who canât do math
grew up in Mathland, a place that is to math what France is to French?” "
===============================================================================
***** Learning can be Open or Closed *****
Most of what we know we learned without conscious direction, through immersion
in the world and in our social surround. Although the skills we acquired in
this natural process of engagement are our highest, our most fluent skills, if
they remain unconscious they will never go anywhere, they are Closed.
Most of what is taught, consciously and successfully in school fails to engage
long-term interest in the students. It is either soon forgotten or is applied
in rote fashion when needed, rather than vigorously expanded upon. When the
student’s interest is not engaged the learning is, once again, Closed.
Closed Learning reaches some level and then stops. It ossifies, becoming less
and less likely to be built-upon as time goes on.
Open Learning is driven by curiosity, often in periods of almost obsessive
concentration. Open Learning is driven by a desire for depth and breadth as
well as connection and integration with everything else in the learner’s world
and existing knowledge. If it stops, then it becomes Closed and ossifies.
Ideally, Open Learning is never completed; obsessive interest dies down to a
more moderate level after a few months and becomes integrated into the
Learner’s more general interests.
The biggest criticism which can be leveled at the current way education
operates in our modern societies is that it discourages Open Learning and the
Love of Learning in most young people.
The ability of a few Learners to come out of their formative years with their
Curiosity and Love of Learning in good shape is a wonderful fact about human
diversity. Like IQ, it speaks to some important characteristics of individuals.
That some Learners will do well even when everything is against them (not
because everything is against them) says little about what we should be doing
to support Learners in general.
Here and there we are able to observe groups of Learners almost all of whom do
extremely well, because of a special teacher or an alternative educational
process. It is a sad fact that our existing educational systems actively avoid
being informed by these successes. We can do better than that.
We know that there are processes which result in nearly all young people
emerging from childhood with
    * an excellent general education
    * a love of learning along with good learning skills
    * adult-level expertise in their area(s) of passion
    * a guarantee of future success
This should be the birthright of all human beings. It is our job to make it so.
Any program of “education” which does not have this as its ultimate aim is
misdirected.
