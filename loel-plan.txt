  Status
      DRAFT
***** LOEL Development Plan *****
This Plan or Roadmap is organized by the construction and maintenance of Tools
to be used by Learners and Peers to support Learners’ Educational Objectives.
Development and improvement of LOEL Tools are ongoing once started.
Essential LOEL_Software_Tools will initially be designed and developed by LOEL
staff. The continued design and development of LOEL Software Tools will be
transferred to Students and Peers managed by Staff as soon as possible.
Eventually most management will also be transferred to Senior Facilitators and
staff will step back into a primarily supportive role.
Please refer to the LOEL_Tools in conjunction with this document.
***** Planning for Exponential Growth *****
This Roadmap is designed to encourage and manage exponential growth. The
problems with exponential growth are
    * in it’s early phases things grow slower than expected
    * in it’s later phases things grow faster than expected
    * it’s unpredictable when the transition from slow to fast will occur
The important things about managing an exponential process is to make sure that
    * the possibility of early large growth is planned for
    * processes tending to damp the exponential growth are identified and
      eliminated
Because of the first problem with exponential growth, this plan may initially
be over-optimistic. We must be prepared for a range of growth rates. Getting
the strategy right will maximize the growth rate and minimize disruption.
The markers Q1 - Q6 are intended as stages of a few months each, perhaps as
short as a quarter, perhaps somewhat longer.
