Intellectually gifted young people are the primary active agents in organizing
and pursuing their education and all other aspects of their growth and
development. They are less in need of a traditional top-down educational system
with “one-size-fits-all” programs and external motivation. Things they can
really use include:
    * Educational Materials
          o Advanced-Beginning Text and Multimedia
          o Self-Tests
          o Syllabi which Organize Courses of Study
    * Interactive Media and Hands-On Projects
          o Immersive Modifiable Simulations
          o Relevant and Challenging Real-World Projects
    * Communication and coordination for
          o Partners and Study Groups
          o Challenging Group Projects
          o Immersive Collaborative Learning Environments
    * Peer Facilitators and Expert Mentors
          o Organizing Courses of Study
          o Dealing with Challenges of
                # Realizing High Aspirations
                # Working with “Default” Culture
When bright young Learners are motivated they can learn a lot faster than
conventional instruction can spoon-feed them. Our best approach for empowering
Learners is to leverage their passion for learning and their natural
orientation towards self-direction by getting them involved in collaborative
projects which give them room to learn at their maximum rate. It is essential
that the best materials they use, especially reference materials and software,
can be adapted and improved by the Learners themselves so that they can
continue to utilize those materials as they advance and so that the
improvements in those materials are available to the next generation of
Learners. Materials with suitable Creative_Commons licenses should be strongly
preferred.
Our best role is in the training of peer facilitators and expert mentors, who
will increasingly consist of the graduates of our programs. We should make
maximum use of the amazing range of existing materials which are increasingly
available through the Internet and we should engage the Learners in projects
which adapt and improve those materials based on their experience in using
them. This strategic approach will maximize the success of our Learners and the
growth of our enterprise.

***** Software Tools & Environments *****
**** Currently Available ****
There are an enormous number of useful individual software applications
designed to be used in education. There are also some powerful software systems
which create an environment in which open-ended learning can take place. Here
are a few of the latter. LOEL Resource Map will eventually contain an
exhaustive list of both kinds of software, properly indexed and classified.
    * Open Software Environments for Learning
          o Dr_Geo
          o Scratch_–>_Snap
          o SqueakLand_EToys
          o Croquet_–>_Open_Cobalt)
          o OpenQwaq
          o Open_Wonderland
          o Squeak
    * SAGE
          o Maxima
          o Sage_Components
Perhaps the most promising environments which can be used for education is
software developed originally for Computer Games. Computer games are high-
quality Simulations of Imagined Worlds. When those worlds are created by Domain
Experts for educational purposes they can be highly effective at supporting
educational objectives with the enthusiastic cooperation of a generation of
students raised on cognitively challenging computer games.
    * Open_Source_Game_Engines
**** Emerging Technology and Low Hanging Fruit ****
A number of software research and development projects for improving effective
collaboration are promising for education. Some of these are new and some are
past projects which were never fully exploited. Developing and adapting these
systems for educational purposes can be excellent projects for our Learners.
    * Immersive_Virtual_Worlds
          o WorldForge
    * Computer Enhanced Communication, Collaboration and Cognition
          o Intelligence_Amplification
          o The_Mother_of_All_Demos
          o Tent_Networking_Protocol
    * Especially Powerful Current Software Frameworks
          o PostgreSQL
          o PostGIS
          o Clojure
          o Flora_Deductive_Object-Oriented_Database
    * Powerful Emerging Software Frameworks
          o Pharo
          o StrongTalk
          o Project_Halo
          o Wicci System
A great model for Learners developing Software is the Google_Summer_of_Code
Program. The model could be improved by putting students in teams and using
peer facilitators with recently acquired skills as well as expert mentors.
