  Status
      DRAFT
This document is a Work-In-Progress!
***** Summary *****
The operations of the League Of Extraordinary Learners are centered around several
strategic web-accessible software tools. These strategic tools support and
coordinate all of our key operations, enabling us to operate with a very lean
staff, and most importantly, enabling the exponential growth of our programs.
All of our educational software tools developed using an Open-Source model to
enable Learners, Peers, Staff and supportive others to study and contribute to
the development of these tools. Adoption of these tools by allied organizations
only serves to further our objectives.
Our tools will avoid “reinventing the wheel” by leveraging key existing Open-
Source software systems.
Although LOEL Tools will initially be designed and developed by LOEL staff, the
bulk of the continued design and development work is to be transferred to
Students and Peers managed by Staff as soon as possible. Eventually most
management will be transferred to Senior Facilitators and staff will assume a
primarily supportive role.
The design of our strategic tools is open-ended. There is a roadmap for
improving each tool without limit. Once the LOEL is fully bootstrapped it is
anticipated that our tools will serve double duty as tools and also as key
practical projects for our Students to engage with. The design and
implementation of all of our tools will reflect this dual purpose.

***** LOEL Software Tool Reference *****
**** LRM: The LOEL Learners’ Resource Map ****
The LRM is an on-line directory of learning resources. Most of the learning
resources are on-line and (most importantly) open, i.e. inspectable, shareable
and improvable by learners and others.
The LRM is a strategic resource which is continually expanded and kept up to
date to support the LOEL’s programs. It is kept in an Advanced Relational
Database System and supports searches for individual resources and also
Learning Paths (sequences of resources required along a Learning Plan).
Components of the LRM Phase
    * Selecting staff (eventually peers) for the LRM Project
    * Ongoing Discovery of Educational Resources
    * Designing the initial LRM Database
    * Designing the initial LRM Web Interface
    * Ongoing LRM growth and improvement
Regular Deliverables
    * Continuous additions and updates of LRM content
    * Resource estimates for next six months
    * Design of next LRM Database or Interface
    * Updates of LRM Database Schemas and Interfaces
**** LP: The LOEL Learning Planner ****
The LP is a tool to allow learners and peers to create Learning Plans which are
feasible courses of study leading to the achievement of learner’s educational
objectives.
Example:
A learner might be interested in Quantum Mechanics. When they go to Wikipedia
they discover that they can’t understand the articles because they’re missing
pre-requisites. They would go to the Learning Planner to explore possible
courses of study which would allow them to achieve their objective.
The Learning Planner is an interactive tool which accesses the LRM and the
learner’s profile to allow the learner to create a Learning Plan which they
find
**** LPS - Learner Profile System ****
The LPS securely stores each student’s learning profile, including
    * Interest Profile
    * Accomplishments
    * Results of Latest Self-Assessment Tests
    * Current Projects
    * Any project roles
    * Contacts
The LPS content is “owned” by the student. It can at any time be
    * downloaded by the student in an open format
    * deleted from the public system at the student’s request
Backups are secured with an encryption key known only to the student.
**** SATS - Self-Assessment Testing System ****
The SATS is designed to deliver Self-Assessment Tests to students on demand.
Tests are automatically constructed from test components (including questions
and challenges) which cover specific elements of knowledge. Tests are
constructed by selecting appropriate components to ensure coverage and (as the
database of components increases to allow this) to make each test unique.
SATS is designed to provide input to the Learning Planner as well as directly
assisting Students in determining their accomplishments and any elements
missing from their objectives.
**** CLMS - Collaborative Learning Management System ****
The CLMS is a system for supporting small groups of Learners together with Peer
Facilitators and Mentors (Expert Volunteers) in pursuing a Learning Path
together.
**** CMMEs - Collaborative Multi-Media Environment(s) ****
CMMEs are immersive Multi-Person Multi-Media Environments. While such
environments are currently best known as the environments for Massive
Multiplayer On-Line Games (MMOGs) they have an equally long history as
environments for supporting collaborative learning, from Plato to Croquet to
the WWW itself.
A number of powerful open-source CMMEs currently exist which would be suitable
as a basis for an LOEL strategic tool.
    * Massive_Multi-Player_Game_Environments
    * Open_Croquet,_Open_Cobalt
**** CMMLE - Collaborative Multi-Media Learning Environment ****
The CMMLE provides the services of our Collaborative Learning Management System
integrated with a a CMME customized (by Learners and Peers with assistance from
Mentors) into an ideal system for Collaborative Learning.
