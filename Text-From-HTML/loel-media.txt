These works are all part of the LOEL_Educational_Resource_Map. While the
Resource Map aims at being comprehensive, this page is intended to present a
selection of resources of especially high quality and strategic impact which is
small enough to invite complete exploration.

***** Jonathan_Haidt *****
    * book:_The_Righteous_Mind
**** Roger_Penrose ****
Sir Roger Penrose is one of the greatest living physicists. He also has written
a number of books which are extraordinary resources for anyone who would like
to learn modern science and mathematics.
    * book:_The_Emperor’s_New_Mind
In order to present his controversial idea that human consciousness is
partially based on quantum phenomena he first needs to bring the reader up to
speed in mathematics, physics and the theory of computation. The journey and
the learning are extraordinary.
    * book:_The_Road_to_Reality:_A_Complete_Guide_to_the_Laws_of_the_Universe
This is a more challenging book which, however, will richly reward any reader
with a strong interest in physics.
**** Steven_Pinker ****
    * book:_The_Language_Instinct
    * book:_How_the_Mind_Works
**** Leonard_Susskind ****
    * book:_The_Theoretical_Minimum
This is the first of two fairly short books designed to teach a scientifically
literate layperson “What you need to know to start doing physics”. It is based
on Susskind’s lecture series of the same name.
**** Robert_Wright ****
    * book:_Nonzero:_The_Logic_of_Human_Destiny

***** Advanced Materials for Partners and Learners, By Topic *****
These books have significant pre-requisites or require greater commitment of
the reader. In many cases they should be used in conjunction with a course of
study with support from Partners.
**** Accelerating Technological Change ****
Science and Technology are driving change at an accelerating rate. The
consequence of this is that the future we are heading towards will not resemble
the past. Some of the coming changes are likely to resemble extrapolations from
existing trends, the evolution of recent developments and known theoretical
possibilities. Others will doubtless take us by surprise.

*** Geometry and Computing ***
One of the best ways to learn Geometry is by interacting with computerized
geometry systems. One of the best ways to learn computing is by writing
programs which construct and manipulate geometrical objects!
    * Turtle_Graphics
    * book:_Turtle_Geometry
    * online_book:_Fractal_Curves
Some computer systems are designed to support learning Euclidean geometry:
    * app:_Dr._Geo
*** Geometric_Algebra ***
Geometric Algebra is a more powerful, expressive, concise and arguably
“natural” mathematical language for much of Physics, Computer Science and other
disciplines than traditional vector, matrix and tensor approaches.
    * Geometric_Algebra_Introduction
  book:_Geometric_Algebra_for_Computer_Science
      by Chris Doran, Anthony Lasenby

      by Leo Dorst, Daniel Fontune, Stephen Mann

*** Logic and Rationality ***
Any SSS who likes the Harry Potter series should at once read
    * online_book:_Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality
There is excellent practical material on Logic and Rationality at
LessWrong
*** Advanced Computing ***
  book:_Concepts,_Techniques_and_Models_of_Computer_Programming
      authors: Peter Van Roy and Seif Haridi
      This is the first book to cover most of the major computer programming
      models. It uses an elegant multi-paradigm programming environment and
      language (Mozart/Oz) for its examples. If you’re seriously interested in
      computer programming, this one is a must read.

===============================================================================
***** Fiction with Educational Value for Partners and Learners *****
Good fiction allows the reader to use their natural ability to learn through
immersion in a well-crafted world. Learning in this way is a powerful
complement to the (usually more distanced “studying”) relationship of reading
non-fiction.
**** Greg_Bear ****
    * book:_Moving_Mars
**** Corey_Doctorow ****
Extraordinary Learners will find nearly all of Corey Doctorow’s work highly
rewarding.
    * book:_Little_Brother
    * book:_Makers
**** Jostein_Gaarder ****
  * book:_Sophie’s_World
      Sophie’s World is a tour of western philosophy through the imagined
      viewpoint of a curious Norwegian girl.

**** Robert_Heinlein ****
Heinlein wrote a series of books for young readers that are still the model for
making hard science and important values accessible to young readers in the
form of exciting and engaging stories.

    * book:_Citizen_of_the_Galaxy
    * book:_Podkayne_of_Mars
    * book:_Space_Cadet

***** Materials primarily for Partners *****
**** The_Arbinger_Institute ****
These books and videos present an excellent and practical model for being more
effective in our relationship to relating to young people and partners.
The videos provide a quick introduction to material which the books go into
much more deeply and thoroughly yet the books are short easy reads.
