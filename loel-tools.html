<p>This document is a Work-In-Progress!</p>
<div class="cols" >

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The operations of the League Of Extraordinary Learners are
centered around several strategic web-accessible software
tools. These strategic tools support and coordinate
all of our key operations, enabling us to operate with a
very lean staff, and most importantly, enabling the
exponential growth of our programs.</p>

<p>All of our educational software tools developed using an
Open-Source model to enable Learners, Peers, Staff and
supportive others to study and contribute to the development
of these tools. Adoption of these tools by allied
organizations only serves to further our objectives.</p>

<p>Our tools will avoid &#8220;reinventing the wheel&#8221; by
leveraging key existing Open-Source software systems.</p>

<p>Although LOEL Tools will initially be designed and
developed by LOEL staff, the bulk of the continued design
and development work is to be transferred to Students and
Peers managed by Staff as soon as possible. Eventually most
management will be transferred to Senior Facilitators and staff will
assume a primarily supportive role.</p>

<p>The design of our strategic tools is open-ended. There
is a roadmap for improving each tool without limit. Once
the LOEL is fully bootstrapped it is anticipated that our
tools will serve double duty as tools and also as key
practical projects for our Students to engage with. The
design and implementation of all of our tools will
reflect this dual purpose.</p>

<h2 id="loelsoftwaretoolreference">LOEL Software Tool Reference</h2>

<h3 id="lrm:theloellearnersresourcemap">LRM: The LOEL Learners&#8217; Resource Map</h3>

<p>The LRM is an on-line directory of learning resources. Most
of the learning resources are on-line and (most importantly)
open, i.e. inspectable, shareable and improvable by learners
and others.</p>

<p>The LRM is a strategic resource which is continually
expanded and kept up to date to support the LOEL&#8217;s programs.
It is kept in an Advanced Relational Database System and
supports searches for individual resources and also
Learning Paths (sequences of resources required along a
Learning Plan).</p>

<p>Components of the LRM Phase</p>

<ul>
<li>Selecting staff (eventually peers) for the LRM Project</li>
<li>Ongoing Discovery of Educational Resources</li>
<li>Designing the initial LRM Database</li>
<li>Designing the initial LRM Web Interface</li>
<li>Ongoing LRM growth and improvement</li>
</ul>

<p>Regular Deliverables</p>

<ul>
<li>Continuous additions and updates of LRM content</li>
<li>Resource estimates for next six months</li>
<li>Design of next LRM Database or Interface</li>
<li>Updates of LRM Database Schemas and Interfaces</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lp:theloellearningplanner">LP: The LOEL Learning Planner</h3>

<p>The LP is a tool to allow learners and peers to create
Learning Plans which are feasible courses of study leading
to the achievement of learner&#8217;s educational objectives.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>A learner might be interested in Quantum Mechanics. When
they go to Wikipedia they discover that they can&#8217;t
understand the articles because they&#8217;re missing
pre-requisites. They would go to the Learning Planner to
explore possible courses of study which would allow them to
achieve their objective.</p>

<p>The Learning Planner is an interactive tool which accesses
the LRM and the learner&#8217;s profile to allow the learner to
create a Learning Plan which they find</p>

<h3 id="lps-learnerprofilesystem">LPS - Learner Profile System</h3>

<p>The LPS securely stores each student&#8217;s learning profile, including</p>

<ul>
<li>Interest Profile</li>
<li>Accomplishments</li>
<li>Results of Latest Self-Assessment Tests</li>
<li>Current Projects</li>
<li>Any project roles</li>
<li>Contacts</li>
</ul>

<p>The LPS content is &#8220;owned&#8221; by the student. It can at any
time be</p>

<ul>
<li>downloaded by the student in an open format</li>
<li>deleted from the public system at the student&#8217;s request</li>
</ul>

<p>Backups are secured with an encryption key known only to the student.</p>

<h3 id="sats-self-assessmenttestingsystem">SATS - Self-Assessment Testing System</h3>

<p>The SATS is designed to deliver Self-Assessment Tests to
students on demand. Tests are automatically constructed
from test components (including questions and challenges)
which cover specific elements of knowledge. Tests are
constructed by selecting appropriate components to ensure
coverage and (as the database of components increases to
allow this) to make each test unique.</p>

<p>SATS is designed to provide input to the Learning Planner as
well as directly assisting Students in determining their
accomplishments and any elements missing from their
objectives.</p>

<h3 id="clms-collaborativelearningmanagementsystem">CLMS - Collaborative Learning Management System</h3>

<p>The CLMS is a system for supporting small groups of Learners
together with Peer Facilitators and Mentors (Expert
Volunteers) in pursuing a Learning Path together.</p>

<h3 id="cmmes-collaborativemulti-mediaenvironments">CMMEs - Collaborative Multi-Media Environment(s)</h3>

<p>CMMEs are immersive Multi-Person Multi-Media Environments.
While such environments are currently best known as the
environments for Massive Multiplayer On-Line Games (MMOGs)
they have an equally long history as environments for
supporting collaborative learning, from Plato to Croquet to
the WWW itself.</p>

<p>A number of powerful open-source CMMEs currently exist which
would be suitable as a basis for an LOEL strategic tool.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_game_engines#Free_and_open_source" target="_blank">Massive Multi-Player Game
 Environments</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Cobalt" target="_blank">Open Croquet, Open Cobalt</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cmmle-collaborativemulti-medialearningenvironment">CMMLE - Collaborative Multi-Media Learning Environment</h3>

<p>The CMMLE provides the services of our Collaborative
Learning Management System integrated with a a CMME
customized (by Learners and Peers with assistance from
Mentors) into an ideal system for Collaborative Learning.</p>
