* Open Content

Much of the progress enriching the modern world is a result of sharing knowledge
and tools rather than keeping such proprietary in the manner of Medieval Guilds
or encumbered with limiting commercial licenses affordable only by a few.

It is especially important for materials used by Learners to be freely shareable
and continue to be available after becoming an integral part of their practice.
Thus, the League of Extraordinary Learners prioritizes Open Content materials.
