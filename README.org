resources about their favorite subjects in Collections.

Learner Participation starts by
- Utilizing resources in a LOEL Collection
- Commenting on these resources
- Recommending additional resources
- Optionally: Directly collaborating with other Learners

** Our Ongoing Transition!

This repository contains the [[https://gregdavidson.github.io/loel][Original LOEL Website]] which is still the most
complete description of the project. We're currently transitioning from using
custom databases on a private server to leveraging Git and being hosted by
GitHub. This should allow us to operate more nimbly in this phase of our
project.
