* The League of Extraordinary Learners

*What would you like to learn?*

This repository contains the [[https://gregdavidson.github.io/loel][Original LOEL Website]] which is still the most
complete description of the project. We're currently transitioning from using
custom databases on a private server to leveraging Git and being hosted by
GitHub. This should allow us to operate more nimbly in this phase of our
project.

Note: Most of our documents are [[https://orgmode.org][OrgMode]] text files. They can be edited online
with any text editor or online with GitHub. With OrgMode-aware editors such as
[[https://github.com/GregDavidson/computing-magic/blob/main/Software-Tools/Emacs/emacs-readme.org][Emacs]], these documents come alive!
