<p>This is a Work-In-Progress! It needs to gloss all of the
terms and principles which appear in the other materials.</p>

<h2 id="learningpartnershipmodel">Learning Partnership Model</h2>

<p>In the Learning Partnership Model Learners, Graduates and
committed Other Partners are encouraged to participate fully
in the ongoing development and improvement of all Learning
Programs and Materials. All the materials and the design of
all programs is freely offered to any other Learners or
groups running educational programs provided they give back
their improvements to the community at large. (Share and
Share-Alike principle).</p>

<h2 id="kellerplanakamasterysystemakapsi">Keller Plan aka Mastery System aka PSI</h2>

<p>In the Keller Plan material to be learned is
divided into modules of related material which are</p>

<ul>
<li>organized according to pre-requisites</li>
<li>accompanied by

<ul>
<li>a variety of study materials (texts, multimedia, etc.)</li>
<li>Homework or Hands-On Projects</li>
<li>rigorous self-tests</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Keller Plan study is normally</p>

<ul>
<li>pursued by a collaborative group</li>
<li>self-paced or group-paced</li>
</ul>

<p>Keller Plan courses may have optional and alternative
modules and allow many different paths for individuals and
groups.</p>

<p>A module or course is only passed if all Learners have
mastered all of its core distinctions.</p>

<h2 id="immersionlearning">Immersion Learning</h2>

<h2 id="intensiveshortcourses">Intensive Short Courses</h2>

<p>Learning Tree&#8217;s intensive Hands-On Courses are an excellent
example of the efficiency and power of Intensive Short
Courses.</p>

<p>Intensive Short Courses are primarily of value when the material learned</p>

<ul>
<li>is a prerequisite for urgent projects</li>
<li>will be immediately and extensively applied right away</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mitlogoandxeroxsmalltalk">MIT Logo and Xerox Smalltalk</h2>

<p>The best STEM-oriented programs I am aware of that have
produced excellent results with middle-school aged Learners
have been the ones operated by Xerox PARC oriented around
the Smalltalk environment and those at MIT oriented around
Pappert&#8217;s LOGO system and Negroponte&#8217;s One Laptop per Child
projects.</p>

<p>All three of these projects use the principle of immersing
the young person in an environment in which the mathematical
and physical material to be learned was directly observable
and manipulable. Rather than trying to micromanage what the
Learners were to do with the material the project staff got
the Learners to create interesting collaborative projects and
then stepped back into the role of peers and mentors.
The result of this approach was that the Learners wound up
going very far and fast with their learning and wound up
with a solid practical ownership of both the abstract
material and the technology.</p>

<h2 id="ucsdcomputersciencekellerplan">UCSD Computer Science Keller Plan</h2>

<p>The project I know best borrowed many of the best ideas from
(1) Xerox PARC&#8217;s Smalltalk Project, (2) MIT&#8217;s LOGO project
along with (3) the mastery-oriented technology of the Keller
Plan plus (4) one more key ingredient I&#8217;ll mention in a
moment. That project was the UCSD P-System Project which
was responsible for introducing all entering UCSD students
in the basics of Computer Science up to writing complex
custom programs of their own design. Although the Students
in our program were just out of high school, I believe that
everything we did would have worked similarly with middle
school or high school aged Students.</p>

<p>The additional key ingredient in our UCSD project was
creating a path allowing and encouraging the Students to take
increasing leadership roles in the project, beginning with
assisting in the lab, then contributing materials and
finally becoming full-fledged project members. In this way
one professor, Ken Bowles, was able to manage a program that
simultaneously trained thousands of students every year
(with unprecedented academic success) and which also
developed a complete operating system and complete set of
software tools more advanced than any then available on
microcomputers.</p>

<p>My experience of bright young Learners is that when they are
motivated they can learn a lot faster than conventional
instruction can spoon-feed them. I believe that our best
approach to empowering Learners is to leverage their passion
for learning and their natural orientation towards
self-direction by getting them invovled in collaborative
projects which give them room to learn at their maximum rate
using materials and technology they can use ongoingly. Our
best role is in the training of peers and mentors,
which will eventually largely consist of the graduates of
our programs. We should also make maximum use of the
amazing range of exisiting materials which are now available
through the Internet and engage the Learners in projects
which adapt and improve those materials based on their
experience. I think that this kind of approach will
maximize the future success of our Learners!</p>
